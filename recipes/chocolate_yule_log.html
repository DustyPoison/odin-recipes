        <p>This Christmas holiday dish is as delicious as it is beautiful! Although it looks quite complicated, it is actually pretty easy. So lets break it down step by step and make you the talk of the neighborhood with your delicious Chocolate Yule Log!</p>
        <p>As a little history lesson, yule logs have been around since before America was founded, first documented in the 17th century in what is modern day Germany. In the 19th century, a nameless French baker decided to commemorate the yule log in pastry form and thus the Chocolate Yule Log was born, bringing good tidings and tasty treats each holiday season.</p>
        <p>Lets break down what we need into different portions:</p>

            <li>2 tablespoons of flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt</li>
            <li>2/3 cup of white sugar</li>
            <li>5 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of vanilla</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of powdered sugar, as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Ganache Frosting:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of boiling hot heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package of dark chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make your filling: Whip together powdered sugar, butter, coffee flavored liqueur, cocoa powder, and salt in a bowl. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Pour mix into separate bowl and add your mascarpone cheese. Once mixed well set aside for later.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees Farenheit.</li>
            <li>Pull out a 13 by 18 inch rimmed sheet pan. Brush some melted butter over your sheet pan, and add parchment paper. Again brush the top of your parchment paper with melted butter.</li>
            <li>Combine your flour, cocoa powder, and salt in a new bowl. Make sure to mix thoroughly.</li>
            <li>In a clean bowl, crack your 5 room temperature eggs and add the sugar. Mix until its fluffy, thick and light in color, for about 2-3 minutes. Mix in your vanilla and 1/2 of the cocoa powder mix. After mixing that for a little bit, add the rest of your cocoa mix and mix well. Make sure the batter is evenly blended.</li>
            <li>Spread the batter onto your sheet pan almost to the edges. To remove air bubbles from the pan, make sure to tap in many times over to get rid of them.</li>
            <li>Place in the oven and bake for 8-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Sift powdered sugar onto a clean kitchen towel, slightly larger than your sponge cake.</li>
            <li>Remove the sponge cake from the oven. Run a knife around the edges of the pan to help lift the edges of the sponge cake. Sprinkle powdered sugar over your cake, and then use a spatula to make sure the parchment paper isn't attached to the pan.</li>
            <li>Flip your cake upside down onto the towel, and remove the parchment paper carefully. Add more powdered sugar on the now top of the cake. Gently roll up the cake inside the towel and let sit for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Carefully unroll your cooled cake. Dollop as much buttercream filling on top as you want, but make sure to save some for later. Roll the cake up over the filling, sprinkle more powdered sugar on top of the log, and then cover in plastic wrap. Place in the refrigerator for about 2 hours, the cake should be firm.</li>
            <li>To make the ganache frosting, pour hot cream over your chocolate chips in a bowl. Wait for 1 minute, and then mix well until the chocolate has melted.</li>
            <li>Make an angled cut around 3 inches from one end of the log. Place your log on a parchment lined sheet pan. Apply some filling to the slice and attach it to one side of the log. Spread some ganache all over the cake, except for the swirls on the ends. Place back in the refrigerator for 15 minutes until the ganache is firm.</li>
            <li>Pull cake out of refrigerator and make lines on your log, try and make it look as realistic or unrealistic as you would like! Once done, place back into refrigerator until it is completely chilled.</li>
            <li>Dust with cocoa powder and powdered sugar before serving. Enjoy!</li>
